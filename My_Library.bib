  abstract = {The observation that heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is associated with elevated circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines opened a new area of research that has revealed a potentially important role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, until the publication in 2019 of the CANTOS trial findings on heart failure outcomes, all attempts to target inflammation in the heart failure setting in phase III clinical trials resulted in~neutral effects or worsening of clinical outcomes. This lack of positive results in turn prompted questions on whether inflammation is a cause or consequence of heart failure. This Review summarizes the latest developments in our understanding of the role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and highlights the results of phase III clinical trials of therapies targeting inflammatory processes in the heart failure setting, such as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory strategies. The most recent of these studies, the CANTOS trial, raises the exciting possibility that, in the foreseeable future, we might be able to identify those patients with heart failure who have a cardio-inflammatory phenotype and will thus benefit from therapies targeting inflammation.},

  abstract = {The immune system is an essential component of a healthy heart. The myocardium is home to a rich population of different immune cell subsets with functional compartmentalization both during steady state and during different forms of inflammation. Until recently, the study of immune cells in the heart required the use of microscopy or poorly developed digestion protocols, which provided enough sensitivity during severe inflammation but were unable to confidently identify small \textemdash{} but key \textemdash{} populations of cells during steady state. Here, we discuss a simple method combining enzymatic (collagenase, hyaluronidase and DNAse) and mechanical digestion of murine hearts preceded by intravascular administration of fluorescently-labelled antibodies to differentiate small but unavoidable intravascular cell contaminants. This method generates a suspension of isolated viable cells that can be analyzed by flow cytometry for identification, phenotyping and quantification, or further purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting or magnetic bead separation for transcriptional analysis or in vitro studies. We include an example of a step-by-step flow cytometric analysis to differentiate the key macrophage and dendritic cell populations of the heart. For a medium sized experiment (10 hearts) the completion of the procedure requires 2\textendash 3 h.},

Here, we combine the CUT\&Tag technology, developed to measure bulk histone modifications, with droplet-based single-cell library preparation to produce high-quality single-cell data on chromatin modifications. We apply single-cell CUT\&Tag (scCUT\&Tag) to tens of thousands of cells of the mouse central nervous system and probe histone modifications characteristic of active promoters, enhancers and gene bodies (H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K36me3) and inactive regions (H3K27me3). These scCUT\&Tag profiles were sufficient to determine cell identity and deconvolute regulatory principles such as promoter bivalency, spreading of H3K4me3 and promoter\textendash enhancer connectivity. We also used scCUT\&Tag to investigate the single-cell chromatin occupancy of transcription factor OLIG2 and the cohesin complex component RAD21. Our results indicate that analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy at single-cell resolution provides unique insights into epigenomic landscapes in the central nervous system.},

Using the American Heart Association framework for the evaluation of novel biomarkers, we review the current evidence supporting the peri-operative use of these two biomarkers. In patients having major non-cardiac surgery who are risk stratified using clinical risk scores, the measurement of natriuretic peptides and troponin, both before and after surgery, significantly improves risk stratification. However, only pre- and postoperative natriuretic peptide measurement and postoperative troponin measurement have shown clinical utility. It is now important for trials to be conducted to determine whether integrating pre- and postoperative natriuretic peptide and postoperative troponin measurement into clinical practice is able to improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.},

  abstract = {Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a subset of leukocytes with lymphoid properties that lack antigen specific receptors. They can be stimulated by and exert their effect via specific cytokine axes, whereas Natural Killers (NK) cells are the only known cytotoxic member of this family. ILCs are considered key in linking the innate and adaptive response in physiologic and pathologic environments. In this study, we investigated the properties of non-cytotoxic cardiac ILCs in physiologic, inflammatory, and ischemic conditions. We found that in healthy humans and mice, non-cytotoxic cardiac ILCs are predominantly a type 2-committed population with progenitor-like features, such as an absence of type-specific immunophenotype, intermediate GATA3 expression, and capacity to transiently express Pro-myelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger protein (PLZF) upon activation. During myocarditis and ischemia, in both human and mice, cardiac ILCs differentiated into conventional ILC2s. We found that cardiac ILCs lack IL-25 receptor and cannot become inflammatory ILC2s. We found a strong correlation between IL-33 production in the heart and the ability of cardiac ILCs to become conventional ILC2s. The main producer of IL-33 was a subset of CD29+Sca-1+ cardiac fibroblasts. ILC2 expansion and fibroblast-derived IL-33 production were significantly increased in the heart in mouse models of infarction and myocarditis. Despite its progenitor-like status in healthy hearts, cardiac ILCs were unable to become ILC1 or ILC3 in vivo and in vitro. Using adoptive transfer and parabiosis, we demonstrated that the heart, unlike other organs such as lung, cannot be infiltrated by circulating ILCs in adulthood even during cardiac inflammation or ischemia. Thus, the ILC2s present during inflammatory conditions are derived from the heart-resident and quiescent steady-state population. Non-cytotoxic cardiac ILCs are a resident population of ILC2-commited cells, with undifferentiated progenitor-like features in steady-state conditions and an ability to expand and develop pro-inflammatory type 2 features during inflammation or ischemia.},

Discrete transcriptional states of ILC1 have been identified in homeostatic and pathological contexts. However, whether these states delineate ILC1 with different functional properties is not completely understood. Here, we show that liver ILC1 are heterogeneous for the expression of distinct effector molecules and surface receptors, including granzyme A (GzmA) and CD160, in mice. ILC1 expressing high levels of GzmA are enriched in the liver of adult mice, and represent the main hepatic ILC1 population at birth. However, the heterogeneity of GzmA and CD160 expression in hepatic ILC1 begins perinatally and increases with age. GzmA+ ILC1 differ from NK cells for the limited homeostatic requirements of JAK/STAT signals and the transcription factor Nfil3. Moreover, by employing Rorc({$\gamma$}t)-fate map (fm) reporter mice, we established that ILC3-ILC1 plasticity contributes to delineate the heterogeneity of liver ILC1, with ROR{$\gamma$}t-fm+ cells skewed toward a GzmA- CD160+ phenotype. Finally, we showed that ILC1 defined by the expression of GzmA and CD160 are characterized by graded cytotoxic potential and ability to produce IFN-{$\gamma$}. In conclusion, our findings help deconvoluting ILC1 heterogeneity and provide evidence for functional diversification of liver ILC1.},

Results:~         The new ranking system significantly correlated with complexity of surgery (P {$<$} 0.0001) as well as with the length of the hospital stay (P {$<$} 0.0001). A total of 144 surgeons from 10 different centers around the world and at different levels of training returned the survey. Ninety percent of the case presentations were correctly graded. The classification was considered to be simple (92\% of the respondents), reproducible (91\%), logical (92\%), useful (90\%), and comprehensive (89\%). The answers of both questionnaires were not dependent on the origin of the reply and the level of training of the surgeons.

The 1,187,535 nuclei in our mouse atlas include 5,068 neurons from the ileum and colon, revealing extraordinary neuron diversity. We highlight circadian expression changes in enteric neurons, show that disease-related genes are dysregulated with aging, and identify differences between the ileum and proximal/distal colon. In humans, we profile 436,202 nuclei, recovering 1,445 neurons, and identify conserved and species-specific transcriptional programs and putative neuro-epithelial, neuro-stromal, and neuro-immune interactions.

Two different waves of thymic progenitors colonize the fetal thymus where they contribute to thymic organogenesis and homeostasis. The origin, the lineage differentiation potential of the first wave, and their relative contribution in shaping the thymus architecture, remained, however, unclear. Here, we show that the first wave of thymic progenitors comprises a unique population of bipotent T and innatel lymphoid cells (T/ILC), generating a lymphoid tissue inducer cells (LTi's), in addition to invariant V{$\gamma$}5+ T cells. Transcriptional analysis revealed that innate lymphoid gene signatures and, more precisely, the LTi-associated transcripts were expressed in the first, but not in the second, wave of thymic progenitors. Depletion of early thymic progenitors in a temporally controlled manner showed that the progeny of the first wave is indispensable for the differentiation of autoimmune regulator\textendash expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). We further show that these progenitors are of strict hematopoietic stem cell origin, despite the overlap between lymphopoiesis initiation and the transient expression of lymphoid-associated transcripts in yolk sac (YS) erythromyeloid-restricted precursors. Our work highlights the relevance of the developmental timing on the emergence of different lymphoid subsets, required for the establishment of a functionally diverse immune system.},

Currently, these are thought to differentiate along a common pathway. However, by fate mapping of single NK cells upon murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, we identified two distinct NK cell lineages that contributed to adaptive-like responses. One was equivalent to conventional NK (cNK) cells while the other was transcriptionally similar to type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s). ILC1-like NK cells showed splenic residency and strong cytokine production but also recognized and killed MCMV-infected cells, guided by activating receptor Ly49H. Moreover, they induced clustering of conventional type 1 dendritic cells and facilitated antigen-specific T~cell priming early during MCMV infection, which depended on Ly49H and the NK cell-intrinsic expression of transcription factor Batf3. Thereby, ILC1-like NK cells bridge innate and adaptive viral recognition and unite critical features of cNK cells and ILC1s.},

It is unclear how ILCs acquire effector function and whether these mechanisms differ between organs. Through multiplexed single-cell mRNA sequencing, we identified cKit+CD127hiTCF-1hi early differentiation stages of T-bet+ ILC1s. These cells were present across different organs and had the potential to mature toward CD127intTCF-1int and CD127-TCF-1- ILC1s. Paralleling a gradual loss of TCF-1, differentiating ILC1s forfeited their expansion potential while increasing expression of effector molecules, reminiscent of T cell differentiation in secondary lymphoid organs. The transcription factor Hobit was induced in TCF-1hi ILC1s and was required for their effector differentiation. These findings reveal sequential mechanisms of ILC1 lineage commitment and effector differentiation that are conserved across tissues. Our analyses suggest that ILC1s emerge as TCF-1hi cells in the periphery and acquire a spectrum of organ-specific effector phenotypes through a uniform Hobit-dependent differentiation pathway driven by local cues.},

A popular example is ATAC-seq, whereby Tn5 transposase inserts sequencing adapters into accessible DNA (`tagmentation'). CUT\&Tag is a tagmentation-based epigenomic profiling method in which antibody tethering of Tn5 to a chromatin epitope of interest profiles specific chromatin features in small samples and single cells. Here, we show that by simply modifying the tagmentation conditions for histone H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 CUT\&Tag, antibody-tethered tagmentation of accessible DNA sites is redirected to produce chromatin accessibility maps that are indistinguishable from the best ATAC-seq maps. Thus, chromatin accessibility maps can be produced in parallel with CUT\&Tag maps of other epitopes with all steps from nuclei to amplified sequencing-ready libraries performed in single PCR tubes in the laboratory or on a home workbench. As H3K4 methylation is produced by transcription at promoters and enhancers, our method identifies transcription-coupled accessible regulatory sites.},

However, human ILC generation has not been systematically explored, and previous in~vitro investigations relied on the analysis of few markers or cytokines, which are suboptimal to assign lineage identity. Here, we developed a platform that reliably generated human ILC lineages from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors derived from cord blood and bone marrow. We showed that one culture condition is insufficient to generate all ILC subsets, and instead, distinct combination of cytokines and Notch signaling are essential. The identity of natural killer (NK)/ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s generated in~vitro was validated by protein expression, functional assays, and both global and single-cell transcriptome analysis, recapitulating the signatures and functions of their ex~vivo ILC counterparts. These data represent a resource to aid in clarifying ILC biology and differentiation.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review~         Children are at risk of severe hypoxemia in the perioperative period owing to their unique anatomy and physiology. Safe and effective airway management strategies are therefore key to the practice of pediatric anesthesia. The goal of this review is to highlight recent publications (2019\textendash 2021) aimed to advance pediatric airway safety and to highlight a proposed simple, pediatric-specific, universal framework to guide clinical practice.         Recent findings~         Recent investigations demonstrate that infants with normal and difficult airways experience high incidences of multiple laryngoscopy attempts and resulting hypoxemia. Video laryngoscopy may improve tracheal intubation first attempt success rate in infants with normal airways. In infants with difficult airways, standard blade video laryngoscopy is associated with higher first attempt success rates over non-standard blade video laryngoscopy. Recent studies in children with Pierre Robin sequence and mucopolysaccharidoses help guide airway equipment and technique selection. Department airway leads and hospital difficult airway services are necessary to disseminate knowledge, lead quality improvement initiatives, and promote evidence-based practice guidelines.         Summary~         Pediatric airway management morbidity is a common problem in pediatric anesthesia. Improvements in individual practitioner preparation and management strategies as well as systems-based policies are required. A simple, pediatric-specific, universal airway management framework can be adopted for safe pediatric anesthesia practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract Histones are subject to a vast array of posttranslational modifications including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation. The writers of these modifications play important roles in normal development and their mutation or misregulation is linked with both genetic disorders and various cancers. Readers of these marks contain protein domains that allow their recruitment to chromatin. Interestingly, writers often contain domains which can read chromatin marks, allowing the reinforcement of modifications through a positive feedback loop or inhibition of their activity by other modifications. We discuss how such positive reinforcement can result in chromatin states that are robust and can be epigenetically maintained through cell division. We describe the implications of these regulatory systems in relation to modifications including H3K4me3, H3K79me3, and H3K36me3 that are associated with active genes and H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 that have been linked to transcriptional repression. We also review the crosstalk between active and repressive modifications, illustrated by the interplay between the Polycomb and Trithorax histone-modifying proteins, and discuss how this may be important in defining gene expression states during development.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor Tcf1 is essential for the development of natural killer (NK) cells. However, its precise role has not been clarified. Our combined analysis of Tcf1-deficient and transgenic mice indicated that Tcf1 guides NK cells through three stages of development. Tcf1 expression directed bone marrow progenitors toward the NK cell lineage and ensured the survival of NK-committed cells, and its downregulation was needed for terminal maturation. Impaired survival of NK-committed cells was due to excessive expression of granzyme B (GzmB) and other granzyme family members, which induced NK cell self-destruction during maturation and following activation with cytokines or target cells. Mechanistically, Tcf1 binding reduced the activity of a Gzmbassociated regulatory element, and this accounted for the reduced Gzmb expression in Tcf1-expressing NK cells. These data identify an unexpected requirement to limit the expression of cytotoxic effector molecules for the normal expansion and function of NK cells.},

Systems theories, including network analysis and machine learning, are well placed for analysing these data but must be applied with an understanding of the relevant biological and computational theories. Through applying these techniques to omics data, systems biology addresses the problems posed by the complex organization of biological processes. In this Review, we describe the techniques and sources of omics data, outline network theory, and highlight exemplars of novel approaches that combine gene regulatory and co-expression networks, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and phenomics with informatics techniques to provide new insights into cardiovascular disease. The use of systems approaches will become necessary to integrate data from more than one omic technique. Although understanding the interactions between different omics data requires increasingly complex concepts and methods, we argue that hypothesis-driven investigations and independent validation must still accompany these novel systems biology approaches to realize their full potential.},

Here, we implemented a CRISPR/Cas9-generated combinatorial reporter approach for the simultaneous resolution of several key TFs throughout ILC development in both the fetal liver and adult bone marrow. We demonstrate that the Tcf7-expressing early innate lymphoid precursor (EILP) and the common helper ILC precursor (CHILP) both contain a heterogeneous mixture of specified ILC and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) precursors with restricted lineage potential rather than a shared precursor. Moreover, the earliest specified precursor to the LTi lineage was identified upstream of these populations, before Tcf7 expression. These findings match dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility associated with the expression of key TFs (i.e., GATA3 and ROR{$\gamma$}(t)), highlighting the distinct origins of ILC and LTi lineages at the epigenetic and functional levels, and provide a revised map for ILC development.},

A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

Keratinocyte-intrinsic responses to ERVs depended on cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) signaling and promoted the induction of commensal-specific T~cells. Inhibition of ERV reverse transcription significantly impacted these responses, resulting in impaired immunity to the microbiota and its associated tissue repair function. Conversely, a lipid-enriched diet primed the skin for heightened ERV- expression in response to commensal colonization, leading to increased immune responses and tissue inflammation. Together, our results support the idea that the host may have co-opted its endogenous virome as a means to communicate with the exogenous microbiota, resulting in a multi-kingdom dialog that controls both tissue homeostasis and inflammation.},

However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. Here we developed simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to different tissues. Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) that significantly overlap with super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin potential as a quantitative measure of chromatin lineage-priming and use it to predict cell fate outcomes. SHARE-seq is an extensible platform to study regulatory circuitry across diverse cells in tissues.},

Importantly, iDEA uses only DE summary statistics as input, enabling effective data modeling through complementing and pairing with various existing DE methods. We illustrate the benefits of iDEA with extensive simulations. We also apply iDEA to analyze three scRNA-seq data sets, where iDEA achieves up to five-fold power gain over existing GSE methods and up to 64\% power gain over existing DE methods. The power gain brought by iDEA allows us to identify many pathways that would not be identified by existing approaches in these data.},

  abstract = {Since their discovery a decade ago, it has become evident that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play critical roles in protective immune responses against intracellular and extracellular pathogens but are also central regulators of epithelial barrier integrity and tissue homeostasis. ILCs populate almost every tissue in mammalian organisms; therefore, not surprisingly, dysregulation of their functions contributes to the development and progression of multiple inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Our knowledge of the transcriptional programs governing the development, differentiation, and functions of the different groups of ILCs has increased dramatically in the last ten years. However, with the advent of new technologies, an unprecedented level of heterogeneity, plasticity, and developmental complexity has started to be revealed. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of ILC development and their biological functions. In particular, we aim to emphasize how our increasing knowledge of the chromatin landscape and the noncoding genome of these innate lymphocytes is allowing us to better understand their development and functions in different contexts during homeostasis and inflammation. Moreover, we propose that the design of more refined genetic tools to study tissue-specific ILCs and their functions can be accomplished by leveraging our understanding of how specific noncoding elements of the genome regulate gene expression in ILCs.},

Our approach pairs sparse scATAC-seq data with robust detection of hundreds of cell surface and intracellular protein markers and optional capture of mitochondrial DNA for clonal tracking, capturing three distinct modalities in single cells. ASAP-seq uses a bridging approach that repurposes antibody:oligonucleotide conjugates designed for existing technologies that pair protein measurements with single-cell RNA sequencing. Together with DOGMA-seq, an adaptation of CITE-seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) for measuring gene activity across the central dogma of gene regulation, we demonstrate the utility of systematic multi-omic profiling by revealing coordinated and distinct changes in chromatin, RNA and surface proteins during native hematopoietic differentiation and peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation and as a combinatorial decoder and reporter of multiplexed perturbations in primary T cells.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are tissue-resident cells that play different roles in different organs by sensing surrounding environmental factors. Initially, it was thought that ILC2s in bone marrow (BM) are progenitors for systemic ILC2s, which migrate to other organs and acquire effector functions. However, accumulating evidence that ILC2s differentiate in peripheral tissues suggests that BM ILC2s may play a specific role in the BM as a unique effector per se. Here, we demonstrate that BM ILC2s highly express the receptor activator of nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B ligand (RANKL), a robust cytokine for osteoclast differentiation and activation, and RANKL expression on ILC2s is upregulated by interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7 and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). BM ILC2s co-cultured with BM-derived monocyte/macrophage lineage cells (BMMs) in the presence of IL-7 induce the differentiation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts in a RANKL-dependent manner. In contrast, BM ILC2s stimulated with IL-33 downregulate RANKL expression and convert BMMs differentiation into M2 macrophage-like cells rather than osteoclasts by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-13 production. Intravital imaging using two-photon microscopy revealed that a depletion of ILC2s prominently impaired in vivo osteoclast activity in an IL-7 plus ATRA-induced bone loss mouse model. These results suggest that ILC2s regulate osteoclast activation and contribute to bone homeostasis in both steady state and IL-33-induced inflammation.},

  abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cell infusions can induce remissions in subsets of patients with different types of cancer. The optimal strategies for NK cell activation prior to infusion are still under debate. There is recent evidence that NK cells can acquire long-term functional competence by preactivation with the cytokines IL-12/15/18. The mechanisms supporting the maintenance of long-term NK cell antitumor activity are incompletely under-stood. Here, we show that NK cells preactivated in vitro with IL-12/15/18, but not with IL-15 alone, maintained high antitumor activity even 1 mo after transfer into lymphopenic RAG-2-/-{$\gamma$}c-/- mice. The NK cell intrinsic ability for IFN{$\gamma$} production coincided with demethylation of the conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) 1 in the Ifng locus, previously shown to enhance transcription of Ifng. In a xenograft melanoma mouse model, human IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells rejected tumors more efficiently. In RAG-2-/-{$\gamma$}c-/- mice, co-transfer of CD4+ T cells further improved the long-term competence of NK cells for IFN{$\gamma$} production that was dependent on IL-2. CD4+ T cell activation during homeostatic proliferation required macrophages and further promoted the long-term NK cell antitumor activity. Thus, NK cells can ``remember'' a previous exposure to cytokines by epigenetic imprinting resulting in a remarkable stability of the IFN{$\gamma$}-producing phenotype after adoptive transfer. In addition, our results support combination of cytokine-preactivated NK cells with CD4+ T cell activation upon lymphopenic conditioning to achieve long-term NK cell effector function for cancer immunotherapy.},

Here, we show that polyamine metabolism is a fundamental process governing the ability of CD4+ helper T~cells (TH) to polarize into different functional fates. Deficiency in ornithine decarboxylase, a crucial enzyme for polyamine synthesis, results in a severe failure of CD4+ T~cells to adopt correct subset specification, underscored by ectopic expression of multiple cytokines and lineage-defining transcription factors across TH cell subsets. Polyamines control TH differentiation by providing substrates for deoxyhypusine synthase, which synthesizes the amino acid hypusine, and mice in which T~cells are deficient for hypusine develop severe intestinal inflammatory disease. Polyamine-hypusine deficiency caused widespread epigenetic remodeling driven by alterations in histone acetylation and a re-wired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Thus, polyamine metabolism is critical for maintaining the epigenome to focus TH cell subset fidelity.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have an increased risk of developing postoperative pneumonia. The pathophysiological causes for this increased risk are still unclear. However it is known that cardiac surgery with CPB strongly influences the systemic immune system. Therefore a change in the pulmonary immune defense, in particular the alveolar macrophages (AMs), could be a reason for the development of postoperative pneumonia. In order to investigate this relationship, we examined the surface molecules of human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) and toll-like receptor 2 and 4 (TLR2/4) on AMs pre- and postoperatively. In addition, an in vitro stimulation of AMs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the subsequent measurement of pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines were performed. The results have been correlated to the development of postoperative pneumonia. Methods: After ethical approval and written informed consent, 33 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were included in this observational study. Peripheral blood cells and alveolar lavage fluid were collected directly after induction of anesthesia and two hours after separation from CPB. HLA-DR expression on monocytes and on AMs as well as TLR2/4 expression on AMs were assessed by flow cytometry. Monocytes and AMs were in vitro stimulated with LPS and the concentration of cytokines (TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10) was determined by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed with the Wilcoxon test and the Mann-Whitney-U test. Results: A total of three patients (9\%) developed postoperative pneumonia. Postoperatively HLA-DR expression on AMs (p = 0.001*) and HLA-DR expression on peripheral blood monocytes (p = 0.001*) was significantly reduced compared to baseline in all patients. After surgery HLA-DR expression on AMs (p = 0.024*) and TLR4 expression on AMs (p = 0.041*) was significantly reduced in patients who developed postoperative pneumonia compared to patients without pneumonia. Already before surgery the baseline of TLR2 expression on AMs was significantly lower (p = 0.027*) in patients who developed postoperative pneumonia. After surgery the concentration of cytokines TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6 and IL-8 was significantly reduced after stimulation of the monocytes with LPS. Postoperatively the concentration of the investigated cytokines TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 was not significantly reduced after stimulation of AMs with LPS. Conclusions: As far as we know this is the first study that shows an early impairment of lung cellular immune response after cardiac surgery. The findings support the hypothesis that these pulmonary changes are associated with the development of postoperative pneumonia.},

Over the last few decades, numerous small animal models have been generated to mimic various pathomechanisms contributing to heart failure (HF). Despite some limitations, these animal models have greatly advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of the different aetiologies of HF and paved the way to understanding the underlying mechanisms and development of successful treatments. These models utilize surgical techniques, genetic modifications, and pharmacological approaches. The present review discusses the strengths and limitations of commonly used small animal HF models, which continue to provide crucial insight and facilitate the development of new treatment strategies for patients with HF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standardized reporting of intraoperative adverse events is important to enhance transparency. To the best of our knowledge, there is no validated definition and classification of intraoperative complications. METHODS: We conducted a two-round Delphi study to develop a definition and classification of intraoperative complications. Experts were contacted by email and sent a link to the online questionnaire. In a pilot study, two independent raters applied the definition and classification in a sample of 60 surgical interventions of low, intermediate, and high complexity and evaluated practicability. Interrater agreement of the classification was determined (raw categorical agreement, weighted kappa, and intraclass correlation). RESULTS: In the Delphi study, 40 of 52 experts (77 \% return rate) from 14 countries took part in each round. The Delphi study resulted in a comprehensive definition of intraoperative complications as any deviation from the ideal intraoperative course occurring between skin incision and skin closure. The classification foresees four grades depending on the need for treatment (no need, grade I; need for treatment, grade II) and the severity of the complication (life-threatening/permanent disability, grade III; death, grade IV). The pilot study showed good practicability (6 on a 7-point scale) and a high raw agreement of 87 \%, a weighted kappa of 0.83 [95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.94] and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95 \% CI 0.73-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: While the Delphi process enabled to develop definitions and classification of intraoperative complications by severity, further research including a multicentre international full-scale validation needs to be conducted with the ultimate goal to contribute to standardized reporting in surgical practice and research.},

Here we report that concomitant metabolic and hypertensive stress in mice\textemdash elicited by a combination of high-fat diet and inhibition of constitutive nitric oxide synthase using N{$\omega$}-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)\textemdash recapitulates the numerous systemic and cardiovascular features of HFpEF in humans. Expression of one of the unfolded protein response effectors, the spliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s), was reduced in the myocardium of our~rodent model and in humans with HFpEF. Mechanistically, the decrease in XBP1s resulted from increased activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and S-nitrosylation of the~endonuclease inositol-requiring protein 1{$\alpha$} (IRE1{$\alpha$}), culminating in defective XBP1 splicing. Pharmacological or genetic suppression of iNOS, or cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of XBP1s, each ameliorated the HFpEF phenotype. We report that iNOS-driven dysregulation of the IRE1{$\alpha$}\textendash XBP1 pathway is a crucial mechanism of cardiomyocyte dysfunction in HFpEF.},

However, the mechanisms by which tissue Th17 cells mediate these dichotomous functions remain unknown. Here, we characterized the heterogeneity, plasticity, and migratory phenotypes of tissue Th17 cells in vivo by combined fate mapping with profiling of the transcriptomes and TCR clonotypes of over 84,000 Th17 cells at homeostasis and during CNS autoimmune inflammation. Inter- and intra-organ single-cell analyses revealed a homeostatic, stem-like TCF1+ IL-17+ SLAMF6+ population that traffics to the intestine where it is maintained by the microbiota, providing a ready reservoir for the IL-23-driven generation of encephalitogenic GM-CSF+ IFN-g+ CXCR6+ T cells. Our study defines a direct in vivo relationship between IL-17+ non-pathogenic and GM-CSF+ and IFN-g+ pathogenic Th17 populations and provides a mechanism by which homeostatic intestinal Th17 cells direct extra-intestinal autoimmune disease.},

Recently, however, our understanding of the epidemiology of these cardiac events has broadened to include myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery, diagnosed by an asymptomatic troponin rise, which also carries a poor prognosis. We review the causation of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery, with potential for prevention and treatment, based on currently available international guidelines and landmark studies. Postoperative arrhythmias are also a frequent cause of morbidity, with atrial fibrillation and QT-prolongation having specific relevance to the peri-operative period. Postoperative systolic heart failure is rare outside of myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery, but the impact of pre-operative diastolic dysfunction and its ability to cause postoperative heart failure is increasingly recognised. The latest evidence regarding diastolic dysfunction and the impact on non-cardiac surgery are examined to help guide fluid management for the non-cardiac anaesthetist.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Heart failure (HF) affects {$\sim$}5.7 million US adults and many of these patients develop non-cardiac disease that requires surgery. The aim of this study was to determine perioperative outcomes associated with HF in a large cohort of patients undergoing in-hospital non-cardiac surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adults {$\geq$}18\,years old undergoing non-cardiac surgery between 2012 and 2014 were identified using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample. Patients with HF were identified by ICD-9 diagnosis codes. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between HF and outcomes. A total of 21~560~996 surgical hospitalizations were identified, of which 1~063~405 (4.9\%) had a diagnosis of HF. Among hospitalizations with HF, 4.7\% had acute HF, 11.3\% had acute on chronic HF, 27.8\% had chronic HF, and 56.2\% had an indeterminate diagnosis code that did not specify temporality. In-hospital perioperative mortality was more common among patients with any diagnosis of HF compared to those without HF [4.8\% vs. 0.78\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.15, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.09-2.22], and the association between HF and mortality was greatest at small and non-teaching hospitals. Acute HF without chronic HF was associated with 8.0\% mortality. Among patients with a chronic HF diagnosis, perioperative mortality was greater in those with acute on chronic HF compared to chronic HF alone (7.8\% vs. 3.9\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001; aOR 1.78, 95\% CI 1.67-1.90). CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalized for non-cardiac surgery, HF was common and was associated with increased risk of perioperative mortality. The greatest risks were in patients with acute HF.},

  abstract = {Perioperative cardiovascular complications occur in 3\% of hospitalizations for noncardiac surgery in the US. This review summarizes evidence regarding cardiovascular risk assessment prior to noncardiac surgery.Preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment requires a focused history and physical examination to identify signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and severe valvular disease. Risk calculators, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, identify individuals with low risk (\&lt;1\%) and higher risk ({$\geq$}1\%) for perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events during the surgical hospital admission or within 30 days of surgery. Cardiovascular testing is rarely indicated in patients at low risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Stress testing may be considered in patients at higher risk (determined by the inability to climb {$\geq$}2 flights of stairs, which is \&lt;4 metabolic equivalent tasks) if the results from the testing would change the perioperative medical, anesthesia, or surgical approaches. Routine coronary revascularization does not reduce perioperative risk and should not be performed without specific indications independent of planned surgery. Routine perioperative use of low-dose aspirin (100 mg/d) does not decrease cardiovascular events but does increase surgical bleeding. Statins are associated with fewer postoperative cardiovascular complications and lower mortality (1.8\% vs 2.3\% without statin use; P\,\&lt;\,.001) in observational studies, and should be considered preoperatively in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease undergoing vascular surgery. High-dose {$\beta$}-blockers (eg, 100 mg of metoprolol succinate) administered 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery are associated with a higher risk of stroke (1.0\% vs 0.5\% without {$\beta$}-blocker use; P\,=\,.005) and mortality (3.1\% vs 2.3\% without {$\beta$}-blocker use; P\,=\,.03) and should not be routinely used. There is a greater risk of perioperative myocardial infarction and major adverse cardiovascular events in adults aged 75 years or older (9.5\% vs 4.8\% for younger adults; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and in patients with coronary stents (8.9\% vs 1.5\% for those without stents; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and these patients warrant careful preoperative consideration.Comprehensive history, physical examination, and assessment of functional capacity during daily life should be performed prior to noncardiac surgery to assess cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular testing is rarely indicated in patients with a low risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but may be useful in patients with poor functional capacity (\&lt;4 metabolic equivalent tasks) undergoing high-risk surgery if test results would change therapy independent of the planned surgery. Perioperative medical therapy should be prescribed based on patient-specific risk.},

Less well understood are the epigenetic alterations that accompany or enable these transcriptional changes. Here, we show that the histone demethylase Lsd1 (Kdm1a) performs a key role in extinguishing stem/progenitor transcriptional programs in addition to key repressive gene programs during thymocyte maturation. Deletion of Lsd1 caused a block in late T cell development and resulted in overexpression of interferon response genes as well as genes regulated by the Gfi1, Bcl6, and, most prominently, Bcl11b transcriptional repressors in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Transcriptional overexpression in Lsd1-deficient thymocytes was not always associated with increased H3K4 trimethylation at gene promoters, indicating that Lsd1 indirectly affects the expression of many genes. Together, these results identify a critical function for Lsd1 in the epigenetic regulation of multiple repressive gene signatures during T cell development.},

Accordingly, ROR{$\gamma$}t-deficient mice lack ILC3 and lymphoid structures, including lymph nodes (LN). Whereas T-bet affects differentiation and functions of ILC3 postnatally, the role of T-bet in regulating fetal ILC3 and LN formation remains completely unknown. Using multiple mouse models and single-cell analyses of fetal ILCs and ILC progenitors (ILCP), here we identify a key role for T-bet during embryogenesis and show that its deficiency rescues LN formation in ROR{$\gamma$}t-deficient mice. Mechanistically, T-bet deletion skews the differentiation fate of fetal ILCs and promotes the accumulation of PLZFhi ILCP expressing central LTi molecules in a ROR{$\alpha$}-dependent fashion. Our data unveil an unexpected role for T-bet and ROR{$\alpha$} during embryonic ILC function and highlight that ROR{$\gamma$}t is crucial in counteracting the suppressive effects of T-bet.},

  abstract = {Heart failure is a syndrome describing the heart\textasciiacute s inability to adequately cover the oxygen demand of metabolizing tissues. Because of the raised life expectancy and the increasing age the prevalence of heart failure in the population is rising. Therefore, the number of patients with heart failure scheduled for surgery is growing which increases the perioperative risk, especially in high-risk-procedures, e.g. vascular and cardiothoracic surgery. All scientific work in the present form of this habilitation dissertation have been developed in order to identify pathophysiologic alterations in an experimental heart failure model (modified infrarenal, aortocaval fistula \textendash{} ACF) and strategies for perioperative risk reduction especially in cardiac surgery. Opioids are the cornerstore of anesthesia, however, knowledge about their pharmcodynamic effects during heart failure is still scarce. In left ventricular cardiomyocytes the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and its endogenous peptide precursor prodynorphin (PDYN) were expressed in healthy male wistar rats. KOR colocalized with L-type Ca2+ -channels (Cav 1.2) on the outer plasma membrane and with intracellular ryanodine receptors (RyR) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum as well as with mitochondria of left ventricular cardiomyocytes. In addition, the cardiac kappa opioid system was activated during the progressive course of heart failure. Opioids thus may have a regulatory function in cardiac calcium and mitochondrial homeostasis. Myocardial apoptosis has been discussed to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of congestive heart failure (CHF). However, recently there is doubt on the evidence of myocardial apoptosis in heart failure as information on ultrastructural changes by electron microscopy is missing. Electron microscopy revealed now direct ultrastructural evidence of extended myocardial apoptosis in \&gt;70\% of left ventricular cardiomyocytes of ACF rats, such as nuclear chromatin condensation, myofibril loss and disarray, contour irregularities and amorphous dense bodies, mitochondriosis and damaged cell-cell-contacts between cardiomyocytes. It thus may be beneficial to administer drugs with known anti-apoptotic effect to reduce perioperative risk, especially in heart failure patients. In a translational context, levosimendan has been shown to possess anti-apoptotic properties in combination with an organ protective effect against ischemia, mediated by activation of mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channels. Its early administration in heart failure patients reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery. In addition, a focused hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiography (hTEE) was feasible to optimize patients\textasciiacute{} hemodynamics and improve their outcome. Taken together, the recent data all present new pathophysiologic alterations and strategies, which have to be investigated in further experimental and clinical studies in order to reduce perioperative risk of heart failure patients.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory cardiomyopathy, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardium and a high risk of deteriorating cardiac function, has a heterogeneous aetiology. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is predominantly mediated by viral infection, but can also be induced by bacterial, protozoal or fungal infections as well as a wide variety of toxic substances and drugs and systemic immune-mediated diseases. Despite extensive research, inflammatory cardiomyopathy complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure or arrhythmia is associated with a poor prognosis. At present, the reason why some patients recover without residual myocardial injury whereas others develop dilated cardiomyopathy is unclear. The relative roles of the pathogen, host genomics and environmental factors in disease progression and healing are still under discussion, including which viruses are active inducers and which are only bystanders. As a consequence, treatment strategies are not well established. In this Review, we~summarize and evaluate the available evidence on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, with a special focus on virus-induced and virus-associated myocarditis. Furthermore, we identify knowledge gaps, appraise the available experimental models and propose future directions for the field. The current knowledge and open questions regarding the cardiovascular effects associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are also discussed.

These tools focus predominantly on sequencing the genomes1, epigenomes2 and transcriptomes3 of single cells. However, despite recent progress in detecting proteins by mass spectrometry with single-cell resolution4, it remains a major challenge to measure translation in individual cells. Here, building on existing protocols5\textendash 7, we have substantially increased the sensitivity of these assays~to enable ribosome profiling in single cells. Integrated with a machine learning approach, this technology achieves single-codon resolution. We validate this method by demonstrating that limitation for a particular amino acid causes ribosome pausing at a subset of the codons encoding the amino acid. Of note, this pausing is only observed in a sub-population of cells correlating to its cell cycle state. We further expand on this phenomenon in non-limiting conditions and detect pronounced GAA pausing during mitosis. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this technique to rare primary enteroendocrine cells. This technology provides a first step towards determining the contribution of the translational process to the remarkable diversity between seemingly identical cells.},

  abstract = {Single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology can infer cell heterogeneity and~reveal relationships across molecular layers. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility allows a multimodal understanding of cell function and epigenetic regulation within individual cells. Here, we offer a protocol to perform scChaRM-seq (single-cell chromatin accessibility, RNA barcoding, and DNA methylation sequencing), which has been applied to study de novo DNA methylation and its relationship with transcription and chromatin accessibility in single human oocytes. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Yan et~al. (2021).},

  abstract = {EOMES and T-BET are related T-box transcription factors that control natural killer (NK) cell development. Here we demonstrate that EOMES and T-BET regulate largely distinct gene sets during this process. EOMES is dominantly expressed in immature NK cells and drives early lineage specification by inducing hallmark receptors and functions. By contrast, T-BET is dominant in mature NK cells, where it induces responsiveness to IL-12 and represses the cell cycle, likely through transcriptional repressors. Regardless, many genes with distinct functions are co-regulated by the two transcription factors. By generating two gene-modified mice facilitating chromatin immunoprecipitation of endogenous EOMES and T-BET, we show a strong overlap in their DNA binding targets, as well as extensive epigenetic changes during NK cell differentiation. Our data thus suggest that EOMES and T-BET may distinctly govern, via differential expression and co-factors recruitment, NK cell maturation by inserting partially overlapping epigenetic regulations.},
